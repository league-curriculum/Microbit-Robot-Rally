# Classes

Classes should be structured so that the students have a motivation of their own
to discover the solutions to problems, and the documentation should be there to
help them figure out the parts of the solution that they wouldn't get on their
own

For a "fun" tech club class, the students might have a fully configured robot,
but longer classes with a learning objective should have the students build
their robots and solve problems. 

Start with a stripped robot; no attachments. Or, to reduce the load on staff,
require that the first exercise require a stripped robot, and let the students
strip what ever robot they get. 

Some issues they will have to overcome:

* Wheelies
* Gripping objects
* Other aspects of the games. 

Give the students a series of challenges that require solving specific problems. 


To encourage students to help other students, make a rule: no one gets to run their robot until 3/4 or all of the class is ready to run their robots.
