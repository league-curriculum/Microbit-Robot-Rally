# Development Notes

## Web Console

Here is a [WebUSB console](https://bsiever.github.io/microbit-webusb/)
([code](https://github.com/bsiever/microbit-webusb)) that can read and display
the serial port messages from a Microbit. This is useful for seeing the
debugging messages. Note that it will only work in Chrome or Firefox browsers. 

It is based  on [DAPjs](https://armmbed.github.io/dapjs/docs/index.html)

Maybe the [more official release. ](https://github.com/microbit-foundation/microbit-connection?utm_source=chatgpt.com)
