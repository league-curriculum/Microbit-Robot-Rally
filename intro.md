# Intro to Microbit


The Micro:bit is a microcontroller, a small computer that has a lot
of extra parts to make it more useful. The computer CPU in your laptop
computer is designed to be very powerfull and do only a few things well. Everything
else that a cimputer night have to do, such as display images on a monitor
or read keystrokes form the keyboard, is handled by other chips. But a 
microcontroller has many of these peripherals built into it, which makes
them easier to use.

Additionally, microntrollers are small and can run off a small battery, so 
they can be built into many other devices. Even your toaster might have a 
microcontroller in it. 

In the next lessons we are going to explore the basics of the Micro:bit micocontroller
and learn how to make simple programs.
