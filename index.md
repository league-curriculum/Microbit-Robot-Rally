# Cutebot Robot Rally

This site will describe several games and contests you can run with a group of
students using the Micro:bit, Cutebots and Joystick:bit joysticks.

The processor for both the Cutebot and the Joystick:bit is a Micro:bit, and the two Micro:bits communicate with a 2.4Ghz radio. The LEAGUE has created custom extensions to make it easer to setup a link between the Joystick and Robot and to allow all of the devices to communicate with each other and game elements. With the addition of Infrared signalling, we can create a variety of competitive games for young students, such as races, destruction derbies, capture the flag, tag, and many others.
