# Game Ideas

## Basic Robot Race

Arrange tiles into a track, with a tape line for start an finish. Robots race around the track. 

Variations:
* Race backwards.

## Obstacle Race

Some students race around the track, other students create moving obstacles
that are either remote controlled or automated using the sonar and other sensors. 


## Tag 

One robot is "it" and can tag other robots by bumping it from behind


## Hungry Hippos

Players collect blocks or balls with the gripper or dozer attachment.
